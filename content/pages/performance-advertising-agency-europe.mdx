## The Problem Most Startups Hit at Scale

You've got a solid in-house team. You're running paid channels. But somewhere between €10K and €100K/month in ad spend, the returns start flattening — CPAs creep up, ROAS dips, and your team is stretched too thin to properly test, iterate, and scale simultaneously. Sound familiar?

European markets add another layer of complexity that most agencies aren't built for. GDPR compliance isn't optional. Multi-country campaigns across DE, FR, NL, SE, and the UK demand localized creative, audience segmentation, and bidding strategies that a US-centric playbook simply can't deliver. One misstep in audience tracking configuration can wipe out your attribution data — and your budget.

At GoScale Media, we operate as a **performance advertising agency for European startups** that already have momentum. We're not here to run basic campaigns. We plug directly into your team, audit what's broken, build what's missing, and execute with the precision of an in-house senior strategist — without the full-time hire cost.

## What You Get When You Work With GoScale

### 1. Ads Audit & Optimization — Fix the Bleeding First

Before spending another euro, we run a forensic audit of your active accounts. We identify wasted spend, broken tracking, underperforming ad sets, and audience overlap — then deliver a prioritized action plan within days. Most clients recover 20–35% of lost budget in the first 30 days. [Learn how we approach Meta Ads in GDPR-compliant markets →](/blog/meta-ads-europe-gdpr-guide-startups)

### 2. Cross-Channel Campaign Management — One Strategy, Every Platform

We manage Meta Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Apple Search Ads, Reddit Ads, Programmatic, and Mobile Ad Networks under one unified growth strategy. No siloed thinking. Every channel informs the next — so your prospecting on TikTok feeds your retargeting on Meta, and your branded search on Google captures the demand you built everywhere else.

### 3. Creative Testing Frameworks — Because Gut Feel Doesn't Scale

Creative is the biggest lever in performance advertising right now, and most teams test it wrong. We build structured testing frameworks — isolating variables, tracking thumb-stop rates, CTRs, and CVRs by hook type, format, and audience — so you know exactly what's working before you scale it. We've seen CTRs jump from 0.8% to 3.2% on the same offer just by changing the opening three seconds.

### 4. Growth Strategy Consulting — Built for European Market Complexity

Expanding from DACH to Benelux? Entering the Nordics? Localizing campaigns across 5 languages while managing VAT registration differences and country-specific ad restrictions? We've done it. Our strategic layer ensures your paid media roadmap is aligned with your GTM motion — not just chasing the next campaign.

### 5. Agency Overflow Support — Your Senior Bench on Demand

Already working with an agency or managing in-house but hitting capacity? We step in as a senior extension of your team. No onboarding friction, no account manager layers — direct access to strategists who've managed €50M+ in ad spend and can execute immediately.

### 6. GDPR-Native Paid Media — Compliant by Default, Not by Accident

We configure every campaign with European data privacy requirements built in — server-side tracking, consent mode, first-party data strategies, and compliant audience modeling. You won't sacrifice performance for compliance. We've helped clients maintain 90%+ attribution accuracy post-iOS 17 and post-GDPR enforcement through robust measurement architecture.

## Trusted by Startups and Agencies That Know Their Stuff

We've worked with brands and teams that have high standards and even higher expectations:

**Ipsy · Jerry · Coalition · Ntegrity · IT Genius · Exactius · EarnIn**

These aren't vanity logos. These are teams that came to us with real problems — plateaued ROAS, broken attribution, scaling inefficiencies — and left with structured, repeatable growth engines.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes GoScale different from other performance advertising agencies in Europe?

We're operationally embedded into your team — not running campaigns from a distance. We're senior practitioners, not account managers handing off to juniors. And we're built specifically for European market complexity: GDPR compliance, multi-country campaigns, localized creative strategy, and EU ad regulations aren't afterthoughts — they're core to how we operate.

### Which paid media channels do you manage?

Meta Ads, Google Ads (Search, Shopping, YouTube, Display), TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Apple Search Ads, Reddit Ads, Programmatic, and Mobile Ad Networks. We build cross-channel strategies where every platform has a defined role — not just a budget allocation.

### Do you work with startups that already have an in-house marketing team?

Yes — that's our sweet spot. We work as a senior extension of your existing team, not a replacement. Whether you need us to own a specific channel, support overflow capacity, or lead strategy while your team executes, we adapt to how you're structured.

### How do you handle GDPR compliance in paid advertising?

We configure campaigns with server-side tracking, Google Consent Mode v2, and first-party data strategies from the start. We stay current on EU-specific ad regulations and country-level requirements — so you're not running campaigns that could trigger a data authority audit or violate Meta's EU-specific policies.

### What budget size do you typically work with?

We work with startups investing €15K/month in ad spend and above. Below that threshold, the leverage we provide doesn't generate sufficient ROI for either side. Our clients typically see the highest impact in the €30K–€500K/month range, where channel strategy, creative testing, and cross-market coordination create the most compounding value.

### How quickly can you start, and what does onboarding look like?

We move fast. After an initial strategy call, we can begin an audit within 48 hours. Active campaign management typically kicks off within one to two weeks, depending on account access and creative asset availability. No six-week onboarding programs — we're operational from week one.
